# orb connection configuration properties.
sunorb.retries=The number of retries if connections cannot be promptly established.
sunorb.retry-interval=The interval in milliseconds between retries.
sunorb.client-timeout=The client-side connection timeout value in milliseconds. A value of zero indicates that the connection never times out.

# orb initializers configuration properties.
sunorb.security=Indicates whether the security interceptors are to be installed (on) or not (off).
sunorb.transactions=Indicates whether the transactions interceptors are to be installed (on or spec) or not (off). The value 'on' enabled JTS while 'spec' enables a spec compliant mode (non JTS) that rejects incoming transaction contexts.

# poa configuration properties.
sunorb.monitoring=Indicates whether the monitoring GUI should be displayed (on) or not (off).
sunorb.queue-wait=Indicates whether requests that exceed the maximum queue size should wait (on) or not (off). When disabled, a TRANSIENT exception is thrown if the queue is full.
sunorb.queue-min=The size of the queue for notifying waiting requests. In other words, blocked requests are only notified when the queue has no more than queue-min requests.
sunorb.queue-max=The maximum number of requests that can be queued.

sunorb.indirection-encoding-disable=Indicates whether indirection encoding for repeated typecodes should be disabled (on) or not (off).
sunorb.strict-check-on-tc-creation=Indicates whether the method create_abstract_interface_tc should perform a validation check on the name parameter (on) or not (off).

# security configuration properties.
sunorb.support-ssl=Indicates whether SSL is to be supported (on) or not (off).
sunorb.security-domain=The name of the security domain that holds the key and trust stores that will be used to establish SSL connections.
sunorb.add-component-via-interceptor=Indicates whether SSL components should be added by an IOR interceptor (on) or not (off).
sunorb.client-supports=Value that indicates the client SSL supported parameters (None, ServerAuth, ClientAuth, MutualAuth).
sunorb.client-requires=Value that indicates the client SSL required parameters (None, ServerAuth, ClientAuth, MutualAuth).
sunorb.server-supports=Value that indicates the server SSL supported parameters (None, ServerAuth, ClientAuth, MutualAuth).
sunorb.server-requires=Value that indicates the server SSL required parameters (None, ServerAuth, ClientAuth, MutualAuth).
